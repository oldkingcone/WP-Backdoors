# WP-Backdoors
Wordpress capable PHP backdoors

# How to use

Add these php scripts to a zip file, in your wordpress admin portal, navigate to the plugin upload page, upload zip file. The plugin will complain about an error being present in the upload, however the shells are still uploaded. This error is due to the WP engine not being able to "execute" the scripts and present you with the uploaded plugin.

You may notice these are a reskin of another Wordpress backdoor, and once i find the repo again, [i will make sure to give credit for the execution of commands function that is present in these shells](https://github.com/leonjza/wordpress-shell/blob/master/shell.php#L47). I do not like to rip off code and believe that credit needs to be given where credit is due.
